# Basic Analysis

Given that assign_elem is recursive, that could have something to do with the memory consumption.  
According to the full timeroutput it does consume memory rivaling that of the recursive backtracking calls.  
Another thing is that the find_mrv_elem is faster the deeper the recursion is.
